# Solve square equation

This is a program to solve quadratic equation of the type `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`.  
The user needs to enter 3 coefficients and the output will be roots of this equation.  
All cases with coefficients are considered(zero coefficients and cases when the equation can't be solved).  
If the user enters non-numeric symbol, the program asks him to repeat the entering.  
All 3 zero coefficients means the exit of the program.  
If you want test the program automatically you can uncomment `#define DEBUG_MOD` and enter coefficients, root quantity and roots themselves in the file `unit_tests.txt`this way(if there is 0 roots, print 0 as 1st and 2nd root):

| number of tests |               |               |               |          |          |
|-----------------|:-------------:|---------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| coefficient a   | coefficient b | coefficient c | root quantity | 1st root | 2nd root |
| coefficient a   | coefficient b | coefficient c | root quantity | 1st root | 2nd root |
