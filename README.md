This is a program to solve quadratic equation of the type `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`.  
All cases with coefficients are considered(zero coefficients and cases when the equation can't be solved). 
If the user enters non-numeric symbol, the proggran asks him to repeat the entering. 
All 3 zero coefficients means the exit of the program.
